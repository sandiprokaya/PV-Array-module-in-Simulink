here in the simulink model, we have got AAVID solar ASMS-165P solar module
with the input  irredence value 100 at the temperature of 25 degree celcius.

for the given model AAVID solar ASMS-165P
the plot between the current, power VS voltage, the follwing conclusionn can be made

1. current increaseas with the increase in voltage.
2. power increases with the increase in voltage.
3. at the certain point of increase in voltge level,the current as well as power decreases.
4. it is shown that at the higher temperature the pv array is less effecient than pv array at lower temperature.
